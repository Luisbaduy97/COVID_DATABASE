   * Temperature
   * Feels like temperature
   * Min temperature
   * Max temperature
   * Pressure
   * Humidity
2. Buscando_en_data_basic.ipynb allows to create a new dataset with features like:
   * Population
   * Urban Population
   * Density
   * Median age
   * Migrants

   * Total deaths from December 31, 2019 until April 19, 2020
4. Uni√≥n_datos.ipynb: allow to create a dataset with information about temperature previously acquired Ambientales.ipynb and with the following features:
